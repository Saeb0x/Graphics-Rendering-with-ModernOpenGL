# 2D/3D Graphics Rendering with Modern OpenGL
An educational YouTube series by Saeb Naser (Saeb0x), in which we take an in depth look at how we can achieve hardware-accelerated graphics with Modern OpenGL. This repository contains the code for each episode in the series.

## Note
The whole project is to be found in the third episode directory, you can directly compile and run. Regarding the other episodes, you can copy the (source/header) files into that specific project and it'll work fine!
